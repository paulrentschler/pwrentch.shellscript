# pwrentch.ShellScript

A PHP class for creating shell scripts.

This class is part of the pwrentch library.

## Compatibility

The library is compatible with PHP 5.x. Currently it does not utilize
namespaces because I still have code that runs on servers with PHP versions
less than 5.3. When that changes, namespaces will be added.


## Installation




## What's with the name?

The name is a play on my name. My last name is commonly misspelled with a "W",
thus Wrentschler rather than Rentschler because it's pronounced "wrench-ler".
Since this is a library of code much like a toolbox and a wrench is typically
found in a toolbox, "wrentch" seemed appropriate. The "P" can stand for "Paul"
or "PHP" which ever you prefer.
